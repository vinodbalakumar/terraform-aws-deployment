# terraform-aws-deployment

To deploy your Spring Boot application in an AWS environment using Terraform and host the endpoint while keeping the Terraform code in a separate GitHub repository with environment-specific configurations, you can follow the steps outlined below. This setup will allow you to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage your AWS resources and easily deploy your Spring Boot application.

1. Prerequisites
Ensure that the following tools are installed and set up:

Spring Boot: Your application ready for deployment (packaged as a JAR or Docker container).
Terraform: Installed on your local machine (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
AWS Account: Active AWS account with programmatic access (AWS CLI configured with access and secret keys).
Docker (optional): If deploying your Spring Boot app as a Docker container.
GitHub Account: Where you’ll keep your Terraform code in a separate repository.
2. Set up Your Spring Boot Application
Make sure your Spring Boot application is packaged and ready for deployment. You can either deploy it directly as a JAR or as a Docker container.

a. Packaging Your Spring Boot App (JAR)
bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean package
This will create a target/your-app-name.jar file.

b. Dockerizing Your Spring Boot App
If you prefer to use Docker, create a Dockerfile in your Spring Boot project:

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-slim
VOLUME /tmp
COPY target/your-app-name.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
Then build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-docker-image .
3. Create Terraform Scripts for AWS Infrastructure
In a separate GitHub repository (e.g., springboot-terraform-deployment), create Terraform scripts to define your AWS infrastructure. Below is an outline of the key components.

a. Folder Structure for Terraform Repository
css
Copy code
springboot-terraform-deployment/
  ├── main.tf
  ├── variables.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  └── environments/
        ├── dev.tfvars
        ├── prod.tfvars
        └── staging.tfvars
b. main.tf – Define AWS Resources
This file will define the infrastructure components for your application. It typically includes:

VPC
EC2 instance or Elastic Beanstalk (to host the app)
Security groups
IAM roles (if needed)
S3 bucket (for app storage, logging, etc.)
RDS instance (if using a database)
Elastic Load Balancer (if scaling)
IAM for access and permissions
